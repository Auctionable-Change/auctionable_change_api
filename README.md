# Auctionable Change API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Auctionable-Change/auctionable_change_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Auctionable-Change/auctionable_change_api)

## Description
**Auctionable Change API** is the backend API for our [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) capstone project, **Auctionable Change**.

The idea behind **A.Change** is creating a platform in which an individual can post an item for sale/auction, set a minimum asking price and then select a charity to which the funds from that item's sale would be donated.

This **API** functions to consume a charity listing/ranking API and return that information to the front end, as well as provide full endpoints for creating, maintaining and accessing information within the database.
